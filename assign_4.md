# Assignment 4: Acquiring, Modifying, and Describing Data

This assignment required me to download land coverage information concerning Brunei from WorldPop and combine it with my previously-existing raster and shapefile data to create a formal object of class RasterStack. I then used the stacked raster layers to create overlapping histograms that provided data on population and night-time lights in the country with corresponding density curves.
