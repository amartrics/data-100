# Extracting Populations from a Raster and Aggregating to Each Unit

For this assignment, I used my ggplot() of Brunei-Darussalam in conjunction with raster data from WorldPop to create a population heat-map. By matching concentrations of color to certain areas of the political map, I made it possible to easily identify the population density of each of the country's four administrative counties. From this map, it is evident that the highest concentration of Brunei's population is settled in Brunei-Muara, which contains the country's capital, while the least are settled on the island county of Temburong.

## Stretch Goal 1

This stretch goal involved plotting counts of population density across a country's secondary admninistrative boundaries.
