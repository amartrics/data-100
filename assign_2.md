# Extracting Populations from a Raster and Aggregating to Each Unit

For this assignment, I used my ggplot() of Brunei-Darussalam in conjunction with raster data from WorldPop to create a population heat-map. By matching concentrations of color to certain areas of the political map, I made it possible to easily identify the population density of each of the country's four administrative counties.
