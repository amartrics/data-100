# De Facto Description of Human Settlements, Urban Areas, Health Facilities, and Topography

For the final project assigned this semester, I produced a spatial plot of the most densely populated areas in a study area of two merged second-level administrative subdivisions in Brunei-Darussalam. The subdivisions in question were Gadong, which has the highest population out of all of Brunei's *mukims*, and Sengkurong, a neighboring subdivision of Gadong to the west. Along with mapping population density in these areas, I also identified the positions of road networks, highlighted in red, orange, and yellow to indicate levels of usage (most to least, respectively) and healthcare facilities, which are represented as blue dots on the map. 

## Urban Areas in Gadong and Sengkurong
