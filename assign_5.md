# Assignment 5: Modeling and Predicting Spatial Values

This lab stipulated the creation and manipulation of several rasters in order to generate 3D and graduated maps of population density per gridcell in the most populous urban area of Brunei-Darussalam in the first-level administrative subdivision of Brunei-Muara as well as the second-level urban subdivision of Gadong. The use of filters and cellStat functions was also employed to perform analyses of the collected data in comparison to actuals. The differentiation in the coloration of pixels represents the accuracy of plotted data.
