# Assignment 5: Modeling and Predicting Spatial Values

This lab stipulated the creation and manipulation of several rasters in order to generate 3D and graduated maps of population density per gridcell in the most populous urban area of Brunei-Darussalam - the administrative subdivision of Gadong. The use of filters and cellStat functions was also employed to perform analyses of the collected data in comparison to actuals. Differentiation in color and height of cels represents the accuracy of plotted data.

The "spikes" in this data likely represent discrepancies in the original file, where it seems that data was processed or collected in a regular pattern with equal amounts of error accorded to certain areas.

The secondary plot produced in this lab used the mapview library, and shows a better representation of the relative inaccuracies in population-per-gridcell counts.
