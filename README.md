*Welcome to my GitHub Assignments Index for Professor Frazier's DATA 100 class, "Wicked Problems." I'm a freshman from outside Washington, D.C. intending to double major in Data Science and Global Studies on the East Asian Studies track. My hobbies include reading, hiking, practicing yoga, thrifting, and drinking too much coffee.*
