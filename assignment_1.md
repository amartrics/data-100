# Assignment 1: Plotting and Labelling Administrative Subdivisions 

For this assignment, I used shapefiles representing the small island country of Brunei to plot a map of the country's international borders, administrative boundaries, and county subdivisions. I utilized libraries, ggplot(), .shp files, and labelling tools to create my own map.
