# Creating a Geometric Bar Plot from a Simple Feature Object

The Challenge Question at the end of this assignment (technically, the deliverable for Project 2.2 according to the syllabus) included generating a bar plot that represents the distribution and density of Brunei's population by first-level adminstrative borders (county lines). I used my shapefile objects and dataframes from the previous assignment to accomplish this.

## Stretch Goal 1 
Stretch Goal 1 of this assignment levied the task of breaking down the plot from the Challenge Question. Creating a sectioned bar graph according to this assignment allowed me to visually represent the division of population density not only across first-level, but also second-level administrative boundaries in Brunei.
